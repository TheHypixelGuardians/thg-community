# Account linking

Binds a Discord user to a Minecraft account. The link is what lets the community bot and
[TriBridge](https://github.com/Trilleo/THGBridge) show the same person on both sides of the guild-chat bridge.

## What is stored

`MinecraftLink`, one row per member, related to `User.id` rather than to the Discord id — the schema
convention. It holds the canonical name Mojang returned and the account's UUID.

**The UUID is why a link survives a rename**: avatar URLs are built from it, so a member who changes their
Minecraft name keeps their head and only the stored name goes stale.

**Both directions are enforced.** One link per Discord user (`userId` is unique) and one Discord user per
Minecraft account (`uuid` is unique, and `setLink` refuses a name already claimed by somebody else). Silently
reassigning an account would let anybody wear a guild member's identity across the bridge.

Links are deliberately **not** scoped to a Hypixel guild: one link per member, whatever guild they are in.

## Verification

`/link` verifies with Mojang that the account exists, and nothing more. It does **not** check Hypixel guild
membership — that check used to run against the live `/guild list` roster, which needs a Minecraft account,
and this bot has none. Anyone can therefore link any real Minecraft name; an admin undoes a wrong one with
`/unlink user:@them`.

A Mojang lookup distinguishes three outcomes, and the reply differs for each: no such account, Mojang
unreachable, and success. Collapsing the middle case into the first would tell a member they typed their own
name wrong when the truth was an outage.

## The link role

`/linkrole set <role>` names a role every linked member should have. `/link` grants it, `/unlink` takes it
back, setting the role backfills it onto everybody already linked, and `clientReady` re-syncs from the stored
links at every startup — so a link made while the bot was down still gets the role.

Two rules hold it together:

- **The role never gates the link.** `applyLinkRole` returns a result instead of throwing; every caller
  reports the failure and carries on. A missing role or a lost **Manage Roles** is a configuration problem,
  not a reason to refuse someone's `/link`.
- **The sync only ever adds.** The role may be handed out for unrelated reasons, so it is never stripped from
  someone merely because they have no link. Changing or clearing the configured role likewise leaves the old
  one on whoever has it.

Members are fetched **one id at a time**, not with a bulk roster fetch. The bot does request the privileged
`GuildMembers` intent, but a single-id fetch is a plain REST call and does not depend on it.

The bot needs **Manage Roles**, and its own highest role must rank above the link role. `/linkrole set`
refuses up front when either is untrue, rather than accepting the setting and failing per member.

## What the bridge does with a link

TriBridge reads `MinecraftLink` and never writes it. A linked member's bridge-channel message is reposted
through a webhook wearing their Minecraft head and name, the original deleted, and the guild-chat copy
attributed to their Minecraft name. Officer chat uses the name too, with no repost.

The bridge caches link lookups for about fifteen seconds and cannot see this bot's writes, so `/link` says the
member's *next* message will be attributed rather than promising an instant change.
