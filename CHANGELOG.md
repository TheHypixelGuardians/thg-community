# Changelog

All notable changes to the THG community bot are documented here.

Format is SkyHanni-style: `##` release section, `###` category, `####` feature area, then `+` bullets.
See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full conventions.

## Unreleased

### Fixes

#### Core
+ Slash commands no longer run twice (removed duplicate `common.ts` event handlers that caused
  `InteractionAlreadyReplied` after `/help` and other commands)
+ `/help` no longer shows an empty Miscellaneous category (moved into Utility; categories with no
  listable commands are omitted from the picker)
+ Removed debug `console.log` spam when browsing `/help` categories

### Technical Details

#### Core

+ Bumped `@discordx/utilities` to 8.0.0 so `@Category` works with `discordx` 11.13 (fixes
  `decorateUnknown is not a function` on startup)
+ Aligned Prisma on stable 7.10.0 for both `prisma` and `@prisma/client` (dropped the mismatched 8 RC CLI)
+ Added `prisma.config.ts`, switched the generator to `prisma-client`, and wired `@prisma/adapter-pg`
+ Shared a single Prisma client from `utils/prisma` (`/profile` and user helpers import it; no second pool)
+ Split Prisma client setup out of `userManager` into `utils/prisma.ts`
+ Raised the Node engine requirement to `>=20.19.0` and upgraded TypeScript to 5.9.3, Biome, chokidar 5,
  and related dependencies

#### Documentation

+ Replaced the discordx template README with a project-accurate description of the THG community bot
  (features, intents, env vars, commands, scripts, structure, database).
+ CLAUDE.md now requires the README to expand as the project expands — new commands, env vars and
  features update it in the same task.
